Build and install
-----------------
The default directory the CyGutz package will be installed is ``~/WIEN_GUTZ/bin``. 
It will be automatically created. 
The makefiles need to be checked for consistency with your machines. 
Thet are ``Gutzwiller_Slave_Boson_Solver/SRC_cmplx/makefile`` and 
``Interface/WIEN2k/Makefile.in``. Then one can run the following command at the top directory to install it::

    $ ./install.sh

The output of the installation script expalins how the code is compiled and installed.
With a successful installation, you will see excutible files ``dmft, dmft2, CyGutz`` 
and other python scripts and a directory ``tools`` located in ``~/WIEN_GUTZ/bin``.

In order to run LDA + Gutzwiller/Slave Boson, WIEN2k needs to be installed separately.
Please refer to user guide of WIEN2k for details.
