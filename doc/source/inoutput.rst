Main executable, input and output files 
=======================================

The majority of the input-output files use a convenient HDF5 metadat format.
See https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/ for details.
We also use a convention that uppercase datasets are stored accordint to
Fortran-language (one-base, collumn-first),
and lower case datasets according to c-language (zero-base, row-first).
This make no difference for scalar or 1-dim arrays. 
For n-dim arrays with n>=2, there is a transposition involved. 

There are three main executable files, namely, ``dmft``, ``CyGutz`` 
and ``dmft2``.

``dmft``
--------

``dmft`` is the executable file generated by compiling the source files
in directory ``ksum`` of the Wien2K interface. 
It is modified version the Kristjan Haule's DMFT-Wien2K interface 
by Yongxin Yao.
It generates the generic Kohn-Sham-Hubbard (_`KSH`) Hamiltonian based on the 
KS band energies and wave functions (_`WF`), 
as well as local projectors, which are expressed in term of 
the KS WFs.

**Input files**

In addition to the input files generated by Wien2K, 
the ONLY input file needed is ``case.indmfl``.
Many of the other input files for the original ``dmft`` are not needed.

**Output files**

For the specific purpose of LDA+G-RISB, 
the output files generated by the modified version of ``dmft`` 
are completely different from the original version. 
These output files are the input files for ``CyGutz``, 
which are supposed to be generated by ``dmft`` only.
The output files are now in hdf5 format. 

* ``GPARAMBANDS.h5``
  HDF5 file storing the main parameters for the DFT calculation,
  along with the local one-body part of the `KSH`_ Hamiltonian (_`H1E`). 
  The dataset structure of the file can be easily seen by typing::

    $ h5ls -r GPARAMBANDS.h5

  It would look like something (e.g., bcc-Fe) below::

    /                        Group
    /IMPURITY_1              Group
    /IMPURITY_1/H1E          Dataset {10, 10}
    /IMPURITY_1/T_SPHERICALHARMONICS_TO_LOCALBASIS1 Dataset {5, 5}
    /NE_LIST                 Dataset {165, 3}
    /delta                   Dataset {1}
    /ismear                  Dataset {1}
    /iso                     Dataset {1}
    /ispin                   Dataset {1}
    /kptdim                  Dataset {1}
    /kptfname                Dataset {1}
    /kptwt                   Dataset {165}
    /nbmax                   Dataset {1}
    /nelectron               Dataset {1}
    /symie                   Dataset {1}
    /symnop                  Dataset {1}

  IMPURITY (upper case) index starts from 1.
  For the main datasets:

    * ``/IMPURITY_1/H1E`` -- one-body part (10 x 10 matrix for d-orbital) 
      of the local Hamiltonian of the first impurity (e.g., Fe atom).
    * ``T_SPHERICALHARMONICS_TO_LOCALBASIS1`` -- unitary transformation 
      (5x5 matrix) from complex spherical harmonics basis (CSH)
      to default local basis (_`DB`), which can be still the same CSH 
      if spin-orbit coupling (_`soc`) is not considered, 
      or relativistic harmonics otherwise.
    * ``/kptdim`` -- dimension of k-points.
    * ``/NE_LIST`` --  array of (kptdim x 3). With

      * NE_LIST[:,1]: total number of bands at each k-point
      * NE_LIST[:,2/3]: the first/last band WF included to expand
        the local ''correlated'' orbitals.
    
    * ``/delta`` -- broadening factor of Gaussian or Fermi smearing function.
    * ``/ismear`` -- gaussian smearing (ismear=0) or Fermi smearing (-1) or
      tetra-hedron method (-5) 
      will be used for the brillouin zone integration.
    * ``/iso`` -- 1 without `soc`_ and 2 with `soc`_.
    * ``/ispin`` -- 1 for paramagnetic DFT calculation. 
      (2 for spin-polarized DFT calculation, which has not been explored.)
    * ``/kptfname`` -- ``case.kgen`` file name. Exclusively for Wien2k.
    * ``/kptwt`` -- k-points weight.
    * ``/nbmax`` -- maximal number of band WFs across all the k-points.
    * ``/nelectron`` -- number of valence electrons for the `KSH`_ model.
    * ``/symnop`` -- number of symmetry operations.
    * ``/symie`` -- the index of the identity operator in the list of 
      symmetry operations.

* ``BAREHAM_0.h5``
  HDF5 file storing the `KSH`_ Hamiltonian matrix for each k-point, 
  and the associated unitary transformation from KS WF basis (_`KSWB`)
  to the `KSH`_ model basis (_`KSHB`) composed of local orbitals 
  and the complement set at the identity symmetry operation. 
  In OpenMPI or OpenMP jobs, file ``BAREHAM_x.h5`` with x from 0 to num_cpu-1
  will be present.
  By typing::

    $ h5ls -r BAREHAM_0.h5

  one can see datasets like::

    ...

  The indices of KPOINTS (e.g., IKP_1) of SYMMETRY operations (e.g., ISYM_1)
  are one-based. With

    * ``/IKP_1/ISYM_1/HK0`` -- the bare `KSH`_ one-particle Hamiltonian matrix 
      at the first k-points and first symmetry operation.

      at the first k-point.
 
``CyGutz``
----------

``CyGutz`` is the driver executable file of the Gutzwiller solver.
It is developed by Yongxin Yao, Nicola Lanata, Gabriel Kotliar,
Cai-Zhuang Wang, and Kai-Ming Ho.

**Input files**

Besides the input files generated by ``dmft`` as listed above, 
The ``init_ga.py`` script also generates an input file, ``GPARAM.h5``.
It contains the parameters specific to the Gutzwiller solver.

For the main datasets:

  * ``/DB_TO_SAB`` -- unitary transformation from `DB`_ basis to the 
    symmetry-adapted basis (_`SAB`). 
  * ``HS`` -- matrix basis set to expand all the local one-body quantities, 
    including quasi-particle density matrix (_`DM`), `H1E`_, etc.

* ``GL.INP``
    Multiple-line file contains the key control parameters of ``CyGutz``. 
    Since there is comments for each line in that file 
    and explanations are also when running ``init_ga.py``, 
    I would repeat here.

* ``WH_HS.INP``
    File storing the list of hermitian matrix basis set compatible with 
    local rotation operations. The basis set is used to expand all the 
    local quantities.

* ``WH_SIGMA_STRUCT.INP``
    File storing the list of self-energy structures.

* ``WH_N2N.INP``
    File storing the list of additional unitary transformations 
    which transforms the local `d/f`-orbitals from the representation 
    specified in ``case.indmfl`` to the symmetry-adapted representation.

Some input file will be generated after the first execution of ``CyGutz``,
to provide possibly better `initial guess` of the G-RISB equations.

* ``GL_NELF1.INP``
    File storing the list of number of local `d/f`-electrons 
    for interaction double counting.

* ``WH_RLNEF.INP``
    File storing the solution {R, :math:`\lambda`} of the G-RISB equation.

**Output files**

* ``GUTZ.LOG`` 
    Main ``CyGutz`` output text file. It contains some detailed information 
    at each cycle of the G-RISB solution. Important local quantities, energies,
    valence block histograms, etc., are printed. The file will be renamed
    to ``GL_LOG.OUT`` before the next charge iteration.

* ``KSWT_myrank.DAT``
    This binary file is generated for each processor involved 
    in the calculation. It stores the renormalized occupation matrix of the 
    LDA bands for every symmetry rotations and k-points in the group.

* ``WH_RLNEF.OUT``
    File storing the solution {R, :math:`\lambda`} of the G-RISB equation.

* ``WH_EL0.OUT``
    File storing the list of one-body part of the local Hamiltonians.

``dmft2``
---------

``dmft2`` is the executable file generated 
by compiling the source files in directory ``chargesc`` 
of the Wien2K interface.
It updates the electron density like lapw2 in Wien2K.
It is a modified version of the Kristjan Haule's DMFT-Wien2K interface 
by Yongxin Yao.

**Input files**

Besides the input files generated by Wien2K, it also needs 
the ``KSWT_0.h5`` file.
