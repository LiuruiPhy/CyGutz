There is a lof of modifications/improvements. 

1. Examples:
   Check https://github.com/yaoyongxin/CyGutz/.

2. GL.INP
   Major part of the entries become "free format".

3. To do calculations without spin-orbit bur using relativisitc Harmonics basis (RH), please follow Ce_NOSOC_NJ_F03. More specifically:
   a) start from your LDA (without spin-orbit) calculations.
   b) run ga_init_dmft.py and choose complex spherical Harmonics (CSH) as the basis.
   c) from the example Ce_NOSOC_NJ_F03 in gitHub copy WH_N2N.INP, which contains the transformation from CSH to RH.
   d) from the example Ce_NOSOC_NJ_F03 in gitHub copy GL.INP, modify U, J, valence range, initial Nf.
   e) run ga_run_dmft.py as usual.
